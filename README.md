## 📂 Project Stages

### 1. 🧹 Data Cleaning
Data integrity is crucial for reliable insights. Key steps taken include:
- **Rectifying negative values** in the `Number of Guests` column.
- **Eliminating outliers** in `Revenue Generated` and `Revenue Realized`.
- **Handling missing values** in the `Ratings Given` column.

### 2. 🔄 Data Transformation
To derive actionable intelligence from raw data, several transformations were applied:
- **Occupancy Percentage**: Introduced as a metric, calculated from successful bookings relative to capacity.
- **Data Transformation for Deeper Insights**: Enhanced dataset to enable a nuanced understanding of occupancy and revenue patterns.

### 3. 📊 Insights Generated
Key insights across occupancy, revenue, and booking trends include:

#### **Occupancy Trends**
- **Presidential rooms** consistently exhibit the highest occupancy rate.
- **Delhi** leads in occupancy, followed closely by other cities.
- **Weekend Bookings**: Occupancy surges to over 70% on weekends compared to 50.9% on weekdays.
- **City-Specific Trends**: Bangalore records the lowest occupancy rate consistently.
- **Data Gaps**: August data is incomplete, available only for Mumbai and Bangalore.

#### **Revenue Analysis**
- **Delhi**: High occupancy but the lowest realized revenue among the cities.
- **Mumbai**: Stands out as the revenue frontrunner.
- **Monthly Trends**: Total revenue peaks in July.

#### **Booking and Payment Analysis**
- **Bangalore** sees a lower average of successful bookings compared to Mumbai.
- **Booking Source Insights**: 40.9% of bookings are made through the "others" payment method, signaling an opportunity for targeted market analysis.

#### **Service Quality & Ratings**
- **Consistency**: Average ratings remain similar across all cities.
- **Ratings Insight**: No city achieved a rating of 4 or above, indicating an area for service improvement.

## 🚀 Business Insights
Based on the analysis, several strategic recommendations emerge:
1. **Optimize Revenue from Cancellations**: Analyzing revenue trends associated with cancellations could offer valuable insights for AtliQ Industries hotels.
2. **Targeted Improvements at AtliQ Seasons**: This branch excels with lower cancellation rates due to competitive pricing and strategic locations.
3. **Enhance Service Quality**: Given ratings across cities remain below 4, initiatives focused on customer satisfaction could significantly benefit AtliQ Grands’ reputation and retention rates.
4. **Explore Booking Methods**: The high percentage of bookings through “other” payment methods presents an opportunity for deeper market segmentation and targeted marketing strategies.
